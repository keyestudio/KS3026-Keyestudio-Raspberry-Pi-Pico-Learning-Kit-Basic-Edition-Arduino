# Project 04: Breathing Led

1.  **Introduction**

In this project, we will learn the PWM control of ARDUINO. PWM is Pulse
Width Modulation, which is a technique that encodes analog signal levels
into digital signal levels. We will use PWM to control the brightness of
LED.

2.  **Component Knowledge**

**Working principle****:** It can control the brightness of LED, the
speed of DC motors and Servo motors, and outputs square wave signal. If
we want to dim the LED, we can change the ON(open) and OFF(close) time
of the signal. When we change the time of ON and OFF fast enough, then
the brightness of the LED will change. Here are some terms related to
PWM as follows.

ON (open)：When the signal is high.

OFF (close)：When the signal is low.

Period: It is the sum of the time of On and Off.

Duty cycle: The percentage of time when the signal is at a high level
for a certain period of time. At 50% duty cycle and 1Hz frequency, the
LED will be on for half a second and off for the other half of a second.

**Arduino and PWM**

The Arduino IDE has a built-in function“analogWrite()”that can be used
to generate PWM signals. Most of the pins generate signals with a
frequency of about 490Hz and we can use this function to give values
from 0 to 255.

“analogWrite(0)” indicates a signal with 0% duty cycle.
“analogWrite(127)” indicates a signal with 50% duty cycle.
“analogWrite(255)” indicates a signal with 100% duty cycle. On the
Plus control board, the PWM pins are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. PWM pins
are marked with the “\~”symbol. In this project, you will learn how to
get the PWM output from the digital pins of the Plus control board and
control the brightness of the LED by code.

**5.Test Code：**

The design of this project makes GP16 output PWM, and the pulse width
gradually increases from 0% to 100%, and then gradually decreases from
100% to 0%.

6.  **Result**

After burning the project code, connecting the wires according to the
wiring diagram, and powering on, the LED lights up gradually, and then
gradually darkens.
